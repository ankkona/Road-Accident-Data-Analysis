# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
This project is focused on examining road accident casualty data to identify patterns related to accident severity, vehicle involvement, road types, surface conditions, location, and time trends. Using Microsoft Excel, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and transformed into meaningful KPIs, which were then visualized through an interactive dashboard. The project aims to support better understanding of accident risks and enable data-driven insights for safety analysis and decision-making.

# Tools Used
- MS Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts(Donut & Pie)
- Slicers & Timelines
- Conditional Formatting

# Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/ankkona/Road-Accident-Data/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data.xlsb">Road Accident Data</a>

# Questions(KPIs)  
- What is the total number of casualties?

- How many casualties are fatal, serious, or slight?

- Which vehicle type causes the highest number of casualties?

- How do current year casualties compare with previous year trends?

- Which road type is most accident-prone?

- Do accidents occur more in urban or rural areas?

- How do light conditions (daylight vs dark) affect accidents?

- What impact does road surface condition (dry, wet, snow/ice) have on casualties?

- How do casualties vary month-wise across years?

# Dashboard : The following dashboard visually answers all the above KPIs and business questions

# Conclusion
This Road Accident Dashboard, built entirely in Excel, effectively converts complex accident data into clear and actionable insights through well-defined KPIs and interactive visuals. It highlights accident severity, identifies high-risk vehicle types, road conditions, and locations, and enables year-wise trend analysis for better understanding of patterns. The dashboard demonstrates strong data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design skills, proving that Excel alone can be used to create professional, decision-support tools suitable for real-world safety analysis, academic projects, and data analyst portfolios.
